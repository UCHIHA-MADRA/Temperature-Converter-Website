The Temperature Conversion Web App is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. The app includes four main elements: an input field, a dropdown menu or radio button, a convert button, and a display area.

To use the app, the user inputs a temperature in either Fahrenheit or Celsius into the input field. The input is validated to ensure that it is a number. Next, the user selects the unit of measurement they are using, either Fahrenheit or Celsius, from the dropdown menu or radio button.

Once the user has inputted their temperature and selected the unit of measurement, they click the "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion. The converted temperature is then displayed in the display area, along with the correct unit of measurement.

For an extra challenge, the app can include a third conversion option to convert temperatures from and to Kelvin as well. The user can select Kelvin from the dropdown menu or radio button, and the app will perform the conversion and display the result in the display area.

In summary, the Temperature Conversion Web App is a powerful tool that allows users to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa. The app includes an input field, a dropdown menu or radio button, a convert button, and a display area. The app can also include a third conversion option to convert temperatures from and to Kelvin. With this app, temperature conversion is easy and accurate.
